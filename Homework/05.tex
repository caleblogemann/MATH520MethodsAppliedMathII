    Let $T$ denote the right shift operator on $\mcl^2$.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(a)]
        Show that $\sigma_p(T) = \varnothing$.

        \begin{proof}
          First I will let $S_+ = T$, so as to better represent the right shift
          operator.
          In order to show that $\sigma_p(S_+) = \varnothing$, we must show that
          $S_+$ has no eigenvalues.
          First I will show that $0$ is not an eigenvalue, if $0$ was an
          eigenvalue then $S_+ x = 0 x = 0$ would have a nonzero solution
          $x \in \mcl^2$.
          However the equation $S_+ x = 0$ guarantees that
          \[
            \p{S_+ x}_k = x_{k-1} = 0
          \]
          for $k \ge 1$, which implies that $x = 0$.
          This shows that the only solution to $S_+ x = 0$ is $x = 0$, so $0$
          is not an eigenvalue of $S_+$, e.g. $0 \not\in \sigma_p(S_+)$.

          Next I will show that no nonzero value can be an eigenvalue.
          Assume to the contrary that $\lambda \neq 0 \in \sigma_p(T)$, that is
          $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$.
          This implies that $S_+ x = \lambda x$ has a nonzero solution
          $x \in \mcl^2$.
          Both $S_+ x$ and $\lambda x$ are sequences and for the sequences to be
          equal each term in the sequences must be equal.
          Therefore I will compare the terms of these sequences.
          Note that by definition $\p{S_+ x}_k = x_{k-1}$ for $k \ge 1$ and
          $\p{S_+ x}_0 = 0$.
          Using this definition, in $S_+ x = \lambda x$ two conditions arise
          first for $k = 0$
          \[
            \lambda x_0 = \p{\lambda x}_0 = \p{S_+ x}_0 = 0
          \]
          and for $k \ge 1$
          \[
            \lambda x_k = \p{\lambda x}_k = \p{S_+ x}_k = x_{k-1}
          \]
          The first condition shows that $x_0 = 0$, and the second that
          $x_k = \frac{x_{k-1}}{\lambda}$.
          However these two statements together inductively show that $x_k = 0$
          for $k \ge 0$.
          Thus $x = 0$ is the only solution to the equation $S_+ x = \lambda x$,
          and $\lambda \not\in \sigma_p(S_+)$.
          This shows that no complex number can be an eigenvalue of $S_+$ and so
          $\sigma_p(S_+) = \varnothing$.
        \end{proof}

      \item[(b)]
        Show that $\sigma_c(T) = \set{\lambda: \abs{\lambda}= 1}$.

        \begin{proof}
          
        \end{proof}

      \item[(c)]
        Show that $\sigma_r(T) = \set{\lambda: \abs{\lambda} < 1}$.

  \item[\#7]
    If $\lambda \neq \pm 1, \pm i$ show that $\lambda$ is in the resolvant set
    of the Fourier Transform $\mcF$.
    (Suggestion: Assuming that a solution of $\mcF u - \lambda u = f$ exists,
    derive an explicit formula for it by justifying and using the identity
    \[
      \mcF^4 u = \lambda^4 u + \lambda^3 f + \lambda^2 \mcF f + \mcF^3 f
    \]
    together with the fact that $\mcF^4 = I$.)

  \item[\#8]
    Let $\v{H} = L^2(0, 1)$, $T_1 u = T_2 u = T_3 u = u'$ on the domains
    \begin{align*}
      D(T_1) &= H^1(0, 1) \\
      D(T_2) &= \set{u \in H^1(0,1): u(0) = 0} \\
      D(T_3) &= \set{u \in H^1(0, 1): u(0) = u(1) = 0}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)]
        Show that $\sigma(T_1) = \sigma_p(T_1) = \CC$.

        \begin{proof}
          
        \end{proof}

      \item[(ii)]
        Show that $\sigma(T_2) = \varnothing$.

        \begin{proof}
          
        \end{proof}

      \item[(iii)]

  \item[\#10]
    Let $Tu(x) = \dintt{0}{x}{K(x, y)u(y)}{u}$ be a Volterra intergral operator
    on $L^2(0, 1)$ with a bounded kernel, $\abs{K(x, y)} \le M$.
    Show that $\sigma(T) = \set{0}$.
    (There are several ways to show that $T$ has no nonzero eigenvalues.
    Here is one approach: Define the equivalent norm on $L^2(0, 1)$
    \[
      \norm[\theta]{u}^2 = \dintt{0}{1}{\abs{u(x)}^2e^{-2\theta x}}{x}
    \]
    and show that the supremum of $\frac{\norm[\theta]{Tu}}{\norm[\theta]{u}}$
    can be made arbitrarily small by choosing $\theta$ sufficiently large.

  \pagebreak
  \item[\#11]
    If $T$ is a symmetric operator, show that
    \[
      \sigma_p(T) \cup \sigma_c(T) \subset \RR
    \]
    (IT is almost the same as showing that $\sigma(T) \subset \RR$ for a
    self-adjoint operator.)

    \begin{proof}
      Let $\lambda = \xi + i \eta$ with $\eta \neq 0$.
    \end{proof}
