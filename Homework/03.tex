\subsection*{Section 11.4}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\#2]
    Verify that $\v{H} \times \v{H}$ is a Hilbert space with the inner product
    given by (11.1.2), and prove Proposition 11.1.

    \begin{proof}
      
    \end{proof}

  \pagebreak
  \item[\#5]
    If $T: D(T) \subset \v{H} \to \v{H}$ is a densely defined linear operator,
    $v \in \v{H}$ and the map $u \to \abr{Tu, v}$ is bounded on $D(T)$, show
    that there exists $v^* \in \v{H}$ such that $(v, v^*)$ is an admissible pair
    for $T^*$.

  \pagebreak
  \item[\#8]
    Show that if $T$ is self-adjoint and one-to-one then $T^{-1}$ is also
    self-adjoint.
    % Hint All you really need to do is show that T^{-1} is densely defined.

  \pagebreak
  \item[\#11]
    Assume that $T$ is closed and $S$ is bounded
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(a)]
        Show that $S + T$ is closed
      \item[(b)]
        Show that $TS$ is closed, but that $ST$ is not closed, in general.
    \end{enumerate}

  \pagebreak
  \item[\#14]
    It $T$ is closable, show that $T$ and $\overline{T}$ have the same adjoint.

\end{enumerate}
